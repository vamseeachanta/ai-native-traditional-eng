- **Refactoring code** involves restructuring existing source code to improve its internal structure, readability, and maintainability—without altering its external functionality. It’s like cleaning up code to make it easier to understand, modify, and extend, while reducing technical debt.

**Key Points:**
- **Improving internal structure:**  
    Focuses on code design, not behavior—like renovating a house while keeping its foundation intact.
- **Not adding new features:**  
    Refactoring does not introduce new functionalities or change how the software works from the user’s perspective.
- **Reducing technical debt:**  
    Makes code easier to understand and modify, preventing future development slowdowns.

**Why refactor?**
- **Increased readability:**  
    Makes code easier for developers to understand and work with, improving collaboration and reducing confusion.
- **Improved maintainability:**  
    Well-refactored code is easier to modify, debug, and extend, saving time and effort in the long run.
- **Reduced complexity:**  
    Simplifies complex code, making it more manageable and less prone to errors.
- **Enhanced extensibility:**  
    Improved structure and clarity make it easier to add new features in the future.
- **Fewer bugs:**  
    Uncovers hidden bugs or vulnerabilities by improving code structure and clarity.

**Common refactoring techniques:**
- **Extract Method:** Break down large, complex methods into smaller, focused methods.
- **Inline Method:** Remove a method by replacing its calls with its contents.
- **Rename Variable/Method:** Use meaningful names to improve readability.
- **Introduce Polymorphism:** Use interfaces and abstract classes for more flexible, maintainable code.
- **Move Method:** Move a method to a more appropriate class.
- **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism:** Use polymorphism to handle different conditions instead of complex if/else statements.

In essence, refactoring is a crucial part of the software development lifecycle that ensures code quality, maintainability, and long-term project success.
