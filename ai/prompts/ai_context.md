Generate ai context file based on following repository Q&A

# ai_context.md contents
- ai_context.md file saved in the ai/context directory
- save sub files with references in ai_context.md
  - Common bash commands in ai_context_bash.md
  - Common git commands in ai_context_git.md
  - Common python commands in ai_context_python.md
  - Core files and utility functions
  - Code style guidelines
  - Testing instructions
  - Repository etiquette (e.g., branch naming, merge vs. rebase, etc.)
  - Developer environment setup (e.g., uv use, pyenv use, which compilers work)
  - Any unexpected behaviors or warnings particular to the project
  - Other information ai engine should remember


# Workflow
- Be sure to typecheck when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
- iterate the code when assigned to ai agent or ai model
  - if context file already exists, update the file for best practices for repository ai context
