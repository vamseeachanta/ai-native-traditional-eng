Generate ai context file based on following repository Q&A

# output
- ai_context.md file in the ai/context directory
- save as sub files with references in ai
- containing the following for ai engine to understand context of the repository
  - Common bash commands
  - Core files and utility functions
  - Code style guidelines
  - Testing instructions
  - Repository etiquette (e.g., branch naming, merge vs. rebase, etc.)
  - Developer environment setup (e.g., uv use, pyenv use, which compilers work)
  - Any unexpected behaviors or warnings particular to the project
  - Other information ai engine should remember

# Bash commands
- npm run build: Build the project
- npm run typecheck: Run the typechecker



# Code style
- how does logging work?
- style of coding
- linting
- identify entry point class function architecture
- Future code
- add best practices relevant for the repository
- add relevant scripts in generic format to the repository to be read by default:
  - ai tools
  - ai models
  - ai agents

- General Code Best Practices
ai\prompts\general_code_best_practices.md

# Workflow
- Be sure to typecheck when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
- iterate the code when assigned to ai agent or ai model
  - if context file already exists, update the file for best practices for repository ai context

---

## 1. Be Explicit and Unambiguous

- **Clarify requirements**: Specify input, output, constraints, and any edge cases.
- **State assumptions**: If something is unclear, clarify it rather than guessing.
- **Prefer clarity over brevity**: Write code and documentation that is easy to read and understand.

## 2. Write Simple, Readable Code

- **Simplicity first**: Use the simplest approach that solves the problem.
- **Readable naming**: Choose descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- **Consistent style**: Follow a consistent code style (indentation, naming, etc.).

## 3. Structure and Organize Code Logically

- **Group related code**: Organize code into logical blocks, functions, or modules.
- **Limit function size**: Keep functions focused and not too long.
- **Decompose problems**: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.

## 4. Handle Errors and Edge Cases

- **Anticipate failure**: Check for invalid inputs and potential error conditions.
- **Graceful handling**: Handle errors explicitly, avoiding silent failures.
- **Test boundaries**: Consider edge cases, such as empty inputs or large data.

## 5. Write Descriptive Comments and Documentation

- **Explain intent**: Comment on non-obvious logic and decisions, not trivial code.
- **Document interfaces**: Provide docstrings or comments for public APIs and functions.
- **Update comments**: Keep comments accurate as code evolves.

## 6. Think About Testing

- **Write tests**: Provide tests for important functionality and edge cases.
- **Automate where possible**: Use automated tests to verify correctness.
- **Test coverage**: Strive for meaningful coverage, especially on critical paths.

## 7. Optimize for Maintainability

- **Refactor as needed**: Improve and clean up code as requirements change.
- **Avoid duplication**: Reuse code where appropriate.
- **Encapsulate complexity**: Hide implementation details behind clear interfaces.

## 8. Ensure Security and Privacy

- **Validate inputs**: Always validate data from untrusted sources.
- **Limit exposure**: Avoid leaking sensitive information in logs or errors.
- **Follow best practices**: Stay up to date with security recommendations for your tech stack.

## 9. Collaborate and Seek Feedback

- **Peer review**: Request code reviews and be open to suggestions.
- **Communicate clearly**: Discuss design choices and alternatives with peers.
- **Learn and adapt**: Incorporate feedback and update practices as needed.

## 10. Stay Current and Pragmatic

- **Use proven tools**: Prefer well-supported libraries and frameworks.
- **Balance idealism and pragmatism**: Make reasonable trade-offs between code quality and delivery.
- **Keep learning**: Stay updated with evolving best practices in your field.
