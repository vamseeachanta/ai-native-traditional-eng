# Documentation Development History

## Overview

This document tracks the development history, prompts, and decisions for the `/docs` folder, which contains comprehensive documentation for AI-native approaches in traditional engineering.

## Initial Creation - December 2024

### Prompt Context

**User Request**: Build a comprehensive, modern, and practical repository for AI-native approaches in traditional engineering, including requirements, folder structure, agent-based workflows, Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, and IT best practices for Windows and Linux environments.

### Design Decisions

- Created `/docs` as a centralized documentation hub
- Organized by topic areas: requirements, methodologies, implementation guides
- Focus on practical, actionable documentation for both technical and business audiences
- Integration with code examples and case studies

### Structure Created

```text
docs/
├── README.md                    # Documentation navigation and overview
├── requirements/                # Requirements analysis and specifications
├── methodologies/              # AI-native engineering methodologies
├── implementation/             # Step-by-step implementation guides
├── best-practices/             # Industry best practices and guidelines
├── apis/                       # API documentation and references
└── troubleshooting/            # Common issues and solutions
```

### Purpose and Goals

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Document all aspects of AI-native engineering
2. **Practical Guidance**: Provide actionable implementation steps
3. **Standards Compliance**: Align with industry standards and best practices
4. **Accessibility**: Make complex concepts accessible to traditional engineers
5. **Maintenance**: Keep documentation current with evolving technologies

### Content Strategy

- Requirements-driven documentation approach
- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Integration with real-world examples
- Cross-references to code and case studies
- Regular updates based on user feedback

## Future Development Plans

- [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Create video tutorials and walkthroughs
- [ ] Develop interactive documentation features
- [ ] Add multilingual support for global audiences
- [ ] Implement documentation testing and validation

## Related Folders

- `/examples`: Code examples referenced in documentation
- `/case-studies`: Real-world implementations documented
- `/frameworks`: Methodologies and frameworks detailed
- `/tools`: Tools and software documented
- `/agents`: Agent documentation and guides

## Prompt History

1. **Initial Repository Creation**: Request for comprehensive AI-native engineering repository
2. **Documentation Strategy**: Focus on practical, actionable guidance
3. **Structure Organization**: Topic-based organization for easy navigation

## Key Decisions Made

- Emphasize practical implementation over theoretical concepts
- Organize by engineering workflow stages
- Include both technical and business perspectives
- Design for multiple skill levels and backgrounds
- Focus on measurable outcomes and ROI
