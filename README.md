AI-native approaches for traditional engineering

## Core Principles

1. **Embed AI in the engineering process** - Use AI tools to assist with design, testing, and deployment from the start.
2. **Leverage AI for optimization** - Apply machine learning to improve system performance and resource utilization.
3. **Automate routine tasks** - Use AI to handle repetitive tasks, freeing engineers to focus on higher-level work.
4. **Enhance collaboration** - Implement AI-driven tools that facilitate communication and knowledge sharing among teams.
5. **Prioritize data-driven decision making** - Use AI analytics to inform engineering choices and project prioritization.
6. **Integrate AI into product lifecycle management** - Use AI to monitor and improve products throughout their lifecycle.
7. **Focus on continuous learning** - Encourage teams to stay updated on AI advancements and integrate new tools as they become available.
8. **Build AI literacy** - Train engineering teams on AI concepts and tools to ensure effective use and innovation.
9. **Foster a culture of experimentation** - Encourage teams to test new AI applications and learn from failures.
10. **Measure impact** - Regularly assess the effectiveness of AI tools and processes to ensure they are delivering value to engineering efforts.
