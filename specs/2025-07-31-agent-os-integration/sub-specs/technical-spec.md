# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-31-agent-os-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-31
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Multi-Platform Installation:** Agent OS framework must install correctly on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Unix systems with AI-native engineering tool support
- **AI Engineering Integration:** System must integrate with existing AI frameworks and traditional engineering modernization approaches
- **Cross-System Synchronization:** Agent OS configurations must synchronize across different AI engineering development environments and team member systems
- **Template Compatibility:** Spec templates must work with AI-native engineering development patterns and traditional engineering integration workflows
- **Automation Script Support:** System must support OS-specific automation scripts for AI engineering tasks (model training, testing, deployment)
- **Git Workflow Integration:** Trunk-based development workflow must integrate with existing AI-native engineering development practices

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Manual Agent OS Installation with AI Tool Integration
- Pros: Full control over AI tool configuration, custom AI framework integration options
- Cons: Time-intensive setup for AI environments, potential for AI tool configuration errors, difficult to replicate across AI engineering teams

**Option B:** Automated Installation with AI-Native Engineering Configuration (Selected)
- Pros: Consistent AI engineering installation process, reduced setup time for AI tools, standardized configuration for AI-native engineering
- Cons: Less flexibility for custom AI framework configurations, dependency on AI engineering automation scripts

**Option C:** Container-Based Agent OS AI Engineering Environment
- Pros: Complete AI environment isolation, consistent AI tools across all systems, reproducible AI engineering setups
- Cons: Additional container complexity, potential AI performance overhead, limited OS integration for AI tools

**Rationale:** Option B selected because it provides the optimal balance of consistency, ease of use, and integration with existing AI-native engineering workflows while maintaining the flexibility needed for different AI frameworks and traditional engineering modernization approaches.
