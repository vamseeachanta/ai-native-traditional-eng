# Case Studies Development History

## Overview
This document tracks the development history, prompts, and decisions for the `/case-studies` folder, which contains real-world examples and implementations of AI-native approaches in traditional engineering.

## Initial Creation - December 2024

### Prompt Context
**User Request**: Build a comprehensive, modern, and practical repository for AI-native approaches in traditional engineering, including requirements, folder structure, agent-based workflows, Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, and IT best practices for Windows and Linux environments.

### Design Decisions
- Created `/case-studies` as a top-level folder to showcase practical implementations
- Organized by engineering domains (mechanical, electrical, civil, chemical)
- Each case study includes problem statement, traditional approach, AI-native solution, and results
- Focus on demonstrable ROI and practical implementation steps

### Structure Created
```

├── README.md                    # Navigation and overview of all case studies
├── mechanical/                  # Mechanical engineering case studies
├── electrical/                  # Electrical engineering case studies
├── civil/                      # Civil engineering case studies
├── chemical/                   # Chemical engineering case studies
├── aerospace/                  # Aerospace engineering case studies
├── manufacturing/              # Manufacturing and production case studies
└── cross-domain/              # Multi-disciplinary case studies
```

### Purpose and Goals
1. **Practical Examples**: Provide concrete examples of AI implementation in traditional engineering
2. **ROI Demonstration**: Show measurable benefits and cost savings
3. **Implementation Guidance**: Offer step-by-step implementation approaches
4. **Domain Coverage**: Cover major engineering disciplines
5. **Scalability**: Examples suitable for startups to enterprise implementations

### Content Strategy
- Real-world scenarios with before/after comparisons
- Technical implementation details
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Lessons learned and best practices
- Integration with existing workflows

## Future Development Plans
- [ ] Add detailed case studies for each engineering domain
- [ ] Include video demonstrations and walkthroughs
- [ ] Develop metrics and KPI tracking examples
- [ ] Create templates for documenting new case studies
- [ ] Add customer testimonials and success stories

## Related Folders
- `/examples`: Technical code examples supporting case studies
- `/frameworks`: Methodologies and frameworks used in case studies
- `/tools`: Tools and software referenced in case studies
- `/agents`: AI agents featured in case studies
- `/it`: IT infrastructure supporting case study implementations

## Prompt History
1. **Initial Repository Creation**: Request for comprehensive AI-native engineering repository
2. **Structure Design**: Folder organization for practical implementation focus
3. **Case Study Framework**: Design for showcasing real-world applications

## Key Decisions Made
- Focus on measurable outcomes and ROI
- Organize by engineering discipline for easy navigation
- Include both technical and business perspectives
- Emphasize practical implementation over theoretical concepts
- Design for scalability from startup to enterprise use cases
