## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install langchain langgraph openai anthropic
pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib
pip install engineering-specific-libraries  # See domain folders
```

### Basic Agent Setup
1. **Choose an agent type** based on your engineering needs
2. **Configure environment** with API keys and tool access
3. **Initialize agent** with domain-specific knowledge base
4. **Test with sample tasks** before production deployment
5. **Monitor and refine** agent performance over time

### Example Agent Workflow
```python
from agents.design import CADDesignAgent

# Initialize agent with engineering knowledge
agent = CADDesignAgent(
    model="gpt-4",
    tools=["solidworks_api", "ansys_api"],
    knowledge_base="mechanical_engineering"
)

# Process design request
result = agent.process_request(
    "Design a lightweight bracket for 500N load with safety factor 2.5"
)

# Review and iterate
design = agent.generate_design(result.requirements)
analysis = agent.analyze_design(design)
optimized = agent.optimize_design(design, analysis)
```
