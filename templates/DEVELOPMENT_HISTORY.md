# Templates Development History

## Overview

This document tracks the development history, prompts, and decisions for the `/templates` folder, which contains standardized templates, boilerplates, and starting points for AI-native engineering implementations.

## Initial Creation - December 2024

### Prompt Context

**User Request**: Build a comprehensive, modern, and practical repository for AI-native approaches in traditional engineering, including requirements, folder structure, agent-based workflows, Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, and IT best practices for Windows and Linux environments.

### Design Decisions

- Created `/templates` to provide standardized starting points
- Organized by template type: projects, documents, configurations
- Focus on practical, ready-to-use templates
- Integration with frameworks and best practices

### Structure Created

```text
templates/
├── README.md                    # Templates overview and usage guide
├── projects/                    # Project scaffolding templates
├── agents/                     # Agent development templates
├── mcp-servers/                # MCP server implementation templates
├── documentation/              # Documentation templates
├── configurations/             # Configuration file templates
├── workflows/                  # Workflow and process templates
└── assessments/                # Assessment and evaluation templates
```

### Purpose and Goals

1. **Rapid Prototyping**: Enable quick project starts with proven templates
2. **Standardization**: Ensure consistent structure and best practices
3. **Quality Assurance**: Provide tested, validated starting points
4. **Learning Aid**: Demonstrate proper structure and implementation patterns
5. **Scalability**: Templates suitable for different organization sizes

### Content Strategy

- Focus on commonly needed project types
- Include comprehensive documentation and examples
- Regular updates based on user feedback
- Integration with repository frameworks and tools
- Support for customization and extension

## Future Development Plans

- [ ] Create comprehensive project scaffolding templates
- [ ] Develop agent development templates with examples
- [ ] Add MCP server implementation templates
- [ ] Create documentation templates for engineering projects
- [ ] Develop assessment and evaluation templates
- [ ] Add configuration templates for common scenarios
- [ ] Create workflow templates for AI implementation

- `/examples`: Working examples based on templates
- `/src`: Core libraries used in templates
- `/mcp`: MCP implementations following templates
- `/agents`: Agent implementations using templates

## Prompt History

1. **Initial Repository Creation**: Request for comprehensive AI-native engineering repository
2. **Template Strategy**: Focus on practical, reusable starting points
3. **Integration Planning**: Alignment with frameworks and implementation patterns

## Key Decisions Made

- Focus on practical, immediately usable templates
- Organize by functional area rather than engineering domain
- Include comprehensive documentation and examples
- Support for customization and extension
- Integration with repository frameworks and best practices
- Regular updates based on community feedback
