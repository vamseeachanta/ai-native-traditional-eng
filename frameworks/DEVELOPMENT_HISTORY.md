# Frameworks Development History

## Overview

This document tracks the development history, prompts, and decisions for the `/frameworks` folder, which contains methodologies, frameworks, and structured approaches for implementing AI-native engineering solutions.

## Initial Creation - December 2024

### Prompt Context

**User Request**: Build a comprehensive, modern, and practical repository for AI-native approaches in traditional engineering, including requirements, folder structure, agent-based workflows, Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, and IT best practices for Windows and Linux environments.

### Design Decisions

- Created `/frameworks` to house structured methodologies and approaches
- Focus on reusable frameworks that can be applied across engineering domains
- Integration with agent-based workflows and practical implementation
- Emphasis on proven methodologies and industry standards

### Structure Created

├── README.md                    # Frameworks overview and navigation
├── agent-based/                 # Agent-based engineering frameworks
├── data-driven/                # Data-driven decision frameworks
├── integration/                # System integration frameworks
├── quality/                    # Quality assurance and testing frameworks
├── security/                   # Security and compliance frameworks
├── collaboration/              # Team collaboration frameworks
└── assessment/                 # Assessment and evaluation frameworks
```

### Purpose and Goals

1. **Structured Approaches**: Provide proven methodologies for AI implementation
2. **Reusability**: Create frameworks applicable across multiple domains
3. **Scalability**: Support frameworks for startups to enterprise implementations
4. **Standards Alignment**: Align with industry standards and best practices
5. **Practical Focus**: Emphasize actionable, implementable frameworks

### Content Strategy

- Focus on proven, tested methodologies
- Include implementation templates and checklists
- Provide assessment tools and metrics
- Integration with examples and case studies
- Regular updates based on industry evolution

## Future Development Plans

- [ ] Develop comprehensive agent-based engineering frameworks
- [ ] Create assessment and maturity models
- [ ] Add framework selection and comparison tools
- [ ] Develop customization guides for different organization sizes
- [ ] Create integration frameworks with existing engineering processes

## Prompt History

1. **Initial Repository Creation**: Request for comprehensive AI-native engineering repository
2. **Framework Strategy**: Focus on structured, reusable methodologies
3. **Integration Planning**: Alignment with agent-based workflows and practical implementation

## Key Decisions Made

- Focus on proven, industry-tested frameworks
- Organize by functional area rather than engineering domain
- Emphasize practical implementation over theoretical models
- Include assessment and evaluation capabilities
- Design for scalability across organization sizes
- Integration with existing engineering processes and tools
