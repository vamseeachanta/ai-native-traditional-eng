# Source Code Development History

## Overview

This document tracks the development history, prompts, and decisions for the `/src` folder, which contains the core Python package for AI-native engineering tools, agents, and utilities.

## Initial Creation - December 2024

### Prompt Context

**User Request**: Build a comprehensive, modern, and practical repository for AI-native approaches in traditional engineering, including requirements, folder structure, agent-based workflows, Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, and IT best practices for Windows and Linux environments.

### Design Decisions

- Created `/src` as a Python package for core functionality
- Organized with modular architecture for extensibility
- Focus on reusable components for agent development
- Integration with MCP servers and engineering workflows

### Structure Created

```

### Initial Implementation

Created foundational components including:

**Base Agent Class (`core/base_agent.py`):**
- Abstract base class for all engineering agents
- Standard interface for agent lifecycle management
- Configuration management and logging
- Error handling and validation
- Integration hooks for MCP and external systems

**Package Structure:**
- Proper Python package initialization
- Modular design for easy extension
- Clear separation of concerns
- Integration points for examples and frameworks

### Purpose and Goals

1. **Reusable Components**: Provide core building blocks for AI-native engineering
2. **Agent Framework**: Standardized framework for engineering agent development
3. **MCP Integration**: Built-in support for Model Context Protocol
4. **Engineering Focus**: Specialized utilities for engineering workflows
5. **Extensibility**: Modular design for custom implementations

### Content Strategy

- Focus on practical, tested implementations
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Modular design for selective usage
- Integration with popular engineering libraries
- Support for multiple deployment scenarios

## Major Developments

### Base Agent Implementation

Created the foundational `BaseAgent` class with:
- Abstract interface for agent development
- Configuration management system
- Logging and error handling
- Lifecycle management (initialize, execute, cleanup)
- Integration hooks for external systems

### Package Architecture

Established modular package structure:
- Core functionality in `/core`
- Agent implementations in `/agents`
- MCP utilities in `/mcp`
- Engineering-specific tools in `/engineering`
- Common utilities in `/utils`

## Future Development Plans

- [ ] Complete agent implementations for major engineering domains
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing framework
- [ ] Develop MCP client libraries
- [ ] Create engineering data processing utilities
- [ ] Add integration adapters for major CAD/CAE software
- [ ] Implement configuration management system
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and analytics

- `/mcp`: MCP servers utilizing src utilities
- `/examples`: Code examples demonstrating src usage
- `/frameworks`: Methodologies implemented in src
- `/tools`: Development tools for src package

## Prompt History

1. **Initial Repository Creation**: Request for comprehensive AI-native engineering repository
2. **Python Package Design**: Modular architecture for core functionality
3. **Base Agent Implementation**: Foundational agent framework
4. **MCP Integration Planning**: Built-in support for Model Context Protocol

## Key Decisions Made

- Python as primary language for core package
- Modular architecture for selective usage
- Abstract base classes for standardized interfaces
- Built-in MCP integration support
- Engineering-specific utility organization
- Comprehensive logging and error handling
- Configuration-driven approach for flexibility
- Integration hooks for external systems
