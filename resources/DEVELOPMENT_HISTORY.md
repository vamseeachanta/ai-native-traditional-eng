# Resources Development History

## Overview

This document tracks the development history, prompts, and decisions for the `/resources` folder, which contains reference materials, datasets, external links, and supporting resources for AI-native engineering implementations.

## Initial Creation - December 2024

### Prompt Context

**User Request**: Build a comprehensive, modern, and practical repository for AI-native approaches in traditional engineering, including requirements, folder structure, agent-based workflows, Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, and IT best practices for Windows and Linux environments.

### Design Decisions

- Created `/resources` as a comprehensive reference hub
- Organized by resource type: datasets, references, tools, libraries
- Focus on curated, high-quality resources relevant to engineering
- Integration with other repository components

### Structure Created

```text
resources/
├── README.md                    # Resources overview and navigation
├── datasets/                    # Engineering datasets and data sources
├── references/                  # Technical papers, standards, and documentation
├── tools/                      # External tools and software recommendations
├── libraries/                  # Recommended libraries and frameworks
├── communities/                # Professional communities and forums
├── training/                   # Training materials and courses
└── vendors/                    # Vendor information and comparisons
```

### Purpose and Goals

1. **Curated Collection**: Provide high-quality, vetted resources
2. **Engineering Focus**: Emphasize resources relevant to traditional engineering
3. **AI Integration**: Include resources specific to AI in engineering
4. **Practical Value**: Focus on actionable, implementable resources
5. **Community Building**: Connect users with broader engineering communities

### Content Strategy

- Curate high-quality, relevant resources
- Regular updates and quality reviews
- Community contributions and recommendations
- Integration with case studies and examples
- Focus on practical implementation value

## Future Development Plans

- [ ] Curate comprehensive engineering datasets
- [ ] Create vendor comparison matrices
- [ ] Develop resource quality rating system
- [ ] Add community contribution guidelines
- [ ] Create resource recommendation engine
- [ ] Develop training pathway recommendations

## Related Folders

- `/docs`: Documentation referencing external resources
- `/examples`: Code examples using recommended libraries
- `/tools`: Internal tools complementing external resources
- `/case-studies`: Real-world applications of resources
- `/frameworks`: Methodologies incorporating external resources

## Prompt History

1. **Initial Repository Creation**: Request for comprehensive AI-native engineering repository
2. **Resource Strategy**: Focus on curated, high-quality external resources
3. **Integration Planning**: Alignment with repository components and user workflows

## Key Decisions Made

- Focus on curation over comprehensiveness
- Emphasize engineering-specific resources
- Include both technical and business resources
- Support community contributions and recommendations
- Regular quality reviews and updates
- Integration with practical implementation examples
