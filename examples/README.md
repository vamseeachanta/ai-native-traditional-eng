## Code Structure

Each domain folder contains:
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step examples
- `scripts/` - Standalone Python/R scripts
- `agents/` - AI agent implementations and configurations
- `data/` - Sample datasets for testing
- `models/` - Pre-trained models and configurations
- `README.md` - Domain-specific guidance

## Getting Started

1. Choose your engineering domain
2. Review the domain README for prerequisites
3. Follow the notebooks for guided examples
4. Adapt scripts for your specific use cases

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Domain-specific libraries (listed in each folder)
