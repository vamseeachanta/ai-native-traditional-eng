# Examples Development History

## Overview

This document tracks the development history, prompts, and decisions for the `/examples` folder, which contains technical code examples and implementations for AI-native engineering approaches.

## Initial Creation - December 2024

### Prompt Context

**User Request**: Build a comprehensive, modern, and practical repository for AI-native approaches in traditional engineering, including requirements, folder structure, agent-based workflows, Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, and IT best practices for Windows and Linux environments.

### Design Decisions

- Created `/examples` as a technical code repository
- Organized by engineering domains for easy navigation
- Focus on working, tested code examples
- Integration with documentation and case studies
- Support for multiple programming languages and platforms

### Structure Created

├── integration/                # System integration examples
└── utilities/                  # Common utilities and helpers
```

### Purpose and Goals

1. **Working Code**: Provide tested, functional code examples
2. **Domain Coverage**: Cover major engineering disciplines
3. **Language Diversity**: Support multiple programming languages
4. **Integration Ready**: Examples ready for real-world integration
5. **Educational Value**: Clear, well-commented code for learning

### Content Strategy

- Focus on practical, real-world examples
- Include comprehensive documentation and comments
- Provide setup and installation instructions
- Test all examples thoroughly
- Regular updates with new technologies

## Recent Developments

### MCP Content Migration

During development, MCP (Model Context Protocol) examples were moved from `/examples/mcp/` to a dedicated `/mcp` folder to better organize and emphasize this important integration capability.

**Migration Details:**
- MCP server examples moved to `/mcp/servers/`
- Configuration examples moved to `/mcp/configs/`
- Updated all cross-references and documentation
- Maintained example links in `/examples` with redirects to new locations

## Future Development Plans

- [ ] Add examples for each engineering domain
- [ ] Create Docker containers for complex examples
- [ ] Develop automated testing for all examples
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking examples
- [ ] Create integration examples with popular CAD/CAE software

## Related Folders

- `/case-studies`: Real-world applications of examples
- `/docs`: Documentation explaining examples
- `/src`: Core library code used in examples
- `/mcp`: Model Context Protocol implementations
- `/tools`: Development and testing tools

## Prompt History

1. **Initial Repository Creation**: Request for comprehensive AI-native engineering repository
2. **Structure Design**: Domain-based organization for technical examples
3. **MCP Migration**: Dedicated folder for Model Context Protocol content
4. **Integration Focus**: Emphasis on real-world, production-ready examples

## Key Decisions Made

- Organize by engineering discipline for intuitive navigation
- Focus on working, tested code over theoretical examples
- Include comprehensive setup and usage instructions
- Support multiple programming languages and platforms
- Maintain clear separation between examples and core library code
- Migrate specialized content (MCP) to dedicated folders when appropriate
