# MCP Development History

## Overview

This document tracks the development history, prompts, and decisions for the `/mcp` folder, which contains Model Context Protocol implementations, servers, and configurations for AI-native engineering applications.

## Initial Creation - December 2024

### Prompt Context

**User Request**: Build a comprehensive, modern, and practical repository for AI-native approaches in traditional engineering, including requirements, folder structure, agent-based workflows, Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, and IT best practices for Windows and Linux environments.

### Design Decisions

- Created dedicated `/mcp` folder for Model Context Protocol content
- Migrated from `/examples/mcp/` to emphasize importance of MCP integration
- Organized by servers, configurations, and documentation
- Focus on practical engineering software integrations

### Structure Created

### Purpose and Goals

1. **Engineering Software Integration**: Connect AI assistants to CAD/CAE tools
2. **Standardized Protocols**: Use MCP for consistent AI-software communication
3. **Practical Implementation**: Provide working examples and configurations
4. **Multi-Platform Support**: Support various engineering software packages
5. **Extensibility**: Enable custom server development for specialized tools

### Content Strategy

- Focus on major engineering software packages
- Provide complete, working server implementations
- Include comprehensive configuration examples
- Detailed setup and troubleshooting documentation
- Support for both development and production environments

## Major Developments

### Migration from Examples

The MCP content was initially created within `/examples/mcp/` but was moved to a dedicated `/mcp` folder to:

- Emphasize the importance of MCP in AI-native engineering
- Provide better organization for server implementations
- Create dedicated space for MCP-specific documentation
- Enable more comprehensive configuration management

### SolidWorks Server Implementation

Created the first concrete MCP server example for SolidWorks integration, including:

- Basic server structure and configuration
- Example API endpoints for CAD operations
- Setup instructions and requirements
- Integration with Claude Desktop and VS Code

## Future Development Plans

- [ ] Complete SolidWorks server implementation with full API coverage
- [ ] Add AutoCAD MCP server implementation
- [ ] Create ANSYS integration for simulation workflows
- [ ] Develop CATIA server for aerospace applications
- [ ] Add Python API integration servers (FreeCAD, OpenSCAD)
- [ ] Create configuration management tools
- [ ] Develop automated testing frameworks for MCP servers

## Related Folders

- `/agents`: AI agents that utilize MCP servers
- `/examples`: Code examples using MCP integrations
- `/src`: Core libraries for MCP server development
- `/tools`: Development and testing tools for MCP
- `/it`: IT infrastructure supporting MCP deployments

## Prompt History

1. **Initial Repository Creation**: Request for comprehensive AI-native engineering repository
2. **MCP Integration Planning**: Emphasis on Model Context Protocol for AI-software integration
3. **Content Migration**: Move from examples to dedicated folder
4. **SolidWorks Implementation**: First concrete server implementation
5. **Configuration Management**: Comprehensive configuration templates and documentation

## Key Decisions Made

- Dedicate separate folder for MCP content due to its importance
- Focus on major commercial engineering software first
- Provide complete, working implementations rather than just examples
- Include comprehensive configuration management
- Support multiple client applications (Claude Desktop, VS Code, custom)
- Emphasize practical deployment and production readiness
- Create extensible framework for custom server development
