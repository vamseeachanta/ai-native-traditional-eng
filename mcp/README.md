# Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Engineers

The Model Context Protocol enables AI assistants to securely connect with your existing engineering tools and data sources, creating a seamless AI-enhanced workflow.

## What is MCP?

MCP is a standardized way for AI models to access and interact with external systems while maintaining security and control. For engineers, this means:

- **Tool Integration** - Connect AI directly to CAD software, simulation tools, and databases
- **Real-time Data Access** - AI can read current project files, specifications, and test results
- **Secure Operations** - You control what the AI can access and modify
- **Workflow Enhancement** - AI becomes a natural part of your existing engineering process

## Repository Structure

### `/servers/`
Custom MCP server implementations for engineering tools:
- CAD system connectors (SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Fusion 360)
- Analysis tool integrations (ANSYS, Abaqus, MATLAB)
- Database connectors (PLM, PDM, material databases)
- Documentation system interfaces

### `/examples/`
Practical examples and use cases:
- Design assistance workflows
- Analysis automation scripts
- Data query examples
- Multi-tool integration patterns

### `/configs/`
Configuration templates and examples:
- Server configuration files
- Permission and security settings
- Tool-specific setup guides
- Deployment configurations

## Practical Applications for Engineers

### Design and CAD Integration

```python
# MCP server connects AI to your CAD system
mcp_server = MCPServer("solidworks_connector")

# AI can now:
# - Read current design parameters
# - Suggest design modifications
# - Generate new components based on specifications
# - Perform automated design validation

# Example: AI-assisted bracket design
design_request = "Optimize this bracket for 20% weight reduction while maintaining strength"
ai_response = assistant.query_with_context(design_request, mcp_server)
```

### Analysis and Simulation Workflows

```python
# Connect AI to your FEA tools
mcp_server = MCPServer("ansys_connector")

# AI can:
# - Set up simulation parameters
# - Interpret analysis results
# - Suggest mesh refinements
# - Compare multiple design iterations

# Example: Automated stress analysis
analysis_task = "Run stress analysis on the modified bracket design"
results = assistant.analyze_with_tools(analysis_task, mcp_server)
```

### Data and Documentation Access

```python
# Connect AI to your engineering databases
mcp_server = MCPServer("engineering_data_connector")

# AI can access:
# - Material property databases
# - Company design standards
# - Previous project documentation
# - Test results and validation data

# Example: Material selection assistance
material_query = "Find suitable materials for high-temperature valve application"
recommendations = assistant.query_database(material_query, mcp_server)
```

## Setting Up MCP for Engineering

### 1. Choose Your Integration Points

- **CAD Software** - SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Fusion 360
- **Analysis Tools** - ANSYS, Abaqus, MATLAB
- **Data Systems** - PLM, PDM, databases
- **Documentation** - Technical specifications, standards

### 2. Install MCP Server

```bash
# Install the MCP framework
pip install model-context-protocol

# Install engineering-specific connectors
pip install mcp-solidworks-connector
pip install mcp-ansys-connector
pip install mcp-database-connector
```

### 3. Configure Access Controls

```yaml
# mcp_config.yaml
servers:
  solidworks:
    path: "mcp-solidworks"
    permissions:
      read: ["models", "drawings", "parameters"]
      write: ["parameters"]  # Limited write access
      
  ansys:
    path: "mcp-ansys"
    permissions:
      read: ["results", "setup"]
      write: ["setup"]
      
  database:
    path: "mcp-database"
    permissions:
      read: ["materials", "standards"]
      write: []  # Read-only access
```

### 4. Test the Integration

```python
# Simple test to verify MCP connection
from mcp import Client

client = Client()
servers = client.list_servers()
print(f"Connected servers: {servers}")

# Test data access
materials = client.query("engineering_db", "SELECT * FROM materials WHERE temp_rating > 200")
print(f"High-temperature materials: {len(materials)} found")
```

## Benefits for Traditional Engineers

### Immediate Value

- **Faster Information Retrieval** - Ask AI to find relevant standards, materials, or past designs
- **Design Assistance** - Get AI suggestions while working in your familiar CAD environment
- **Quality Checks** - Automated validation against company standards and best practices
- **Documentation Help** - AI can generate reports, specifications, and analysis summaries

### Enhanced Workflows

- **Iterative Design** - AI continuously analyzes and suggests improvements during design
- **Cross-Domain Integration** - Connect mechanical, electrical, and software design decisions
- **Knowledge Preservation** - Capture and reuse expert knowledge across projects
- **Compliance Automation** - Ensure designs meet industry standards and regulations

## Security and Control Considerations

### Data Protection

- MCP servers run locally or in your controlled environment
- You define exactly what data AI can access
- All interactions are logged and auditable
- Sensitive information never leaves your network

### Access Management

- Role-based permissions for different team members
- Tool-specific access controls (read vs. write)
- Time-limited access for temporary projects
- Emergency disconnect capabilities

### Best Practices

- Start with read-only access to non-critical systems
- Gradually expand permissions as comfort grows
- Regular security audits of MCP configurations
- Backup systems before enabling AI modifications
